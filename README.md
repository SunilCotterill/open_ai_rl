# Summary
This repo was a personal project in which I hoped to learn more about reinforcement learning. I followed sentdex's [Stable Baselines 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbWhJdQgi7E&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf0O2DWwLZBfJeYY-JOeZB1) tutorial. Models and logs were not included for size concerns.

# Lunar Lander
Uses OpenAI's Gymnasium library and Stable Baselines 3 to train a reinforcement model on Gymnasium's [Lunar Lander](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).

# Snake Game
Uses OpenAI's Gymnasium library and Stable Baselines 3 to train a reinforcement model on [TheAIlearner's Snake Game](https://github.com/TheAILearner/Snake-Game-using-OpenCV-Python/tree/master). Line 20-21 in rl_snake.py need to be altered for local use (swap the commenting).
